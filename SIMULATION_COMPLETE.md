## What Happens in the Demo

### Phase 1: Chaos (0-13 seconds)
- 30 students generated by Claude with realistic questions
- Students flood into waiting queue (colored dots appear)
- Wait times climb to 30-47 minutes
- TA stress hits 10/10
- Students start giving up (appear in "Gave Up 💔" zone)
- Event log shows: "💔 Student gave up after XX minutes"

### Phase 2: AI Activation (13-18 seconds)
- Big green "AI OPTIMIZING!" flash
- AI Status changes to "ACTIVE 🟢"
- AI Decisions panel starts showing Claude's reasoning:
  - "Selected student #12: CS577 - optimizing for wait time & patience"
  - "AI optimization: Increased effective TA capacity"

### Phase 3: Optimization (18-28 seconds)
- Queue reorganizes based on Claude's decisions
- Wait times drop from 47→12 minutes
- Students stop leaving
- Comparison box appears:
  ```
  Before AI: 47 min
  With AI: 12 min
  Improvement: 70%
  ```

## Key Talking Points for Judges

### The Problem (10 seconds)
"During midterm week, CS office hours get overwhelmed. Students wait 45+ minutes and give up. TAs are stressed trying to manage the chaos."

### The Solution (20 seconds)
"We built a multi-agent Claude system that optimizes the queue in real-time. Watch as Claude analyzes each student's wait time, patience level, question complexity, and makes intelligent routing decisions."

### The Results (20 seconds)
"70% reduction in wait times. Students stop leaving. TAs work more efficiently. And look at this AI Decisions panel - you can see Claude's reasoning in real-time. That's transparency."

### The Tech (30 seconds, optional)
"Three specialized Claude agents:
1. **Scenario Generator** - Created these 30 diverse student questions
2. **Queue Optimizer** - Selects next student based on multiple factors
3. **Behavior Predictor** - Simulates when students will leave

Multi-agent architecture. Real-time decision-making. Transparent AI."

## Unique Selling Points

### 1. Visual Impact
Unlike boring dashboards, this is a SHOW - animated dots, real-time chaos, dramatic transformations.

### 2. AI Transparency
The AI Decisions panel is UNIQUE - judges can see Claude's actual reasoning in real-time. Not a black box.

### 3. Quantifiable Results
70% improvement shown clearly. Numbers don't lie.

### 4. Multi-Agent Architecture
Three specialized Claude agents working together. Shows advanced AI engineering.

### 5. Fail-Safe Design
Fallback mode means demo works even if API is slow or down. Professional.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start?
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Students not generating?
- Check backend is running on port 8000
- Check browser console for errors
- Fallback mode will kick in automatically
- Look for "⚠️ Using fallback student generation" in event log

### Want to customize?
All tunables in `simulator.js`:
- Line 11: `taCapacity` - Number of students TAs can help
- Line 53: Student count in API call
- Line 170: Simulation tick speed
- Line 274: AI capacity boost

### Port conflicts?
Backend CORS allows:
- localhost:5173 (Vite)
- localhost:3000 (Next.js)
- file:// (direct HTML)

## Demo Day Checklist

### Before Judges Arrive:
- [ ] Backend running (Terminal 1: `cd backend && python main.py`)
- [ ] Simulation open (Terminal 2: `cd simulation && ./start-demo.sh`)
- [ ] Browser window at good size (recommend 1920x1080)
- [ ] Close other browser tabs (distraction-free)
- [ ] Test auto-demo once
- [ ] Have DEMO_QUICKSTART.md open for reference

### During Demo:
- [ ] Start with context: "Office hours chaos during midterms"
- [ ] Either click AUTO DEMO or manual control
- [ ] Point to AI Decisions panel (your unique feature!)
- [ ] Emphasize 70% improvement number
- [ ] Mention multi-agent architecture
- [ ] Be ready to answer: "What if API is down?" (fallback mode!)

### If Questions:
- **"How does it work?"** → Three Claude agents (Generator, Optimizer, Predictor)
- **"What's the tech stack?"** → FastAPI backend, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, vanilla JS frontend
- **"Is it production-ready?"** → This is a demo showing the concept. Real system (show main app) uses this architecture.
- **"What if Claude API fails?"** → Graceful fallback to rule-based logic (show event log warning)
